Create custom sidebars for your posts or pages.

== Description ==

This plugin enables you to customize your blog's sidebar using custom fields.  Each page or post on your blog can have a custom sidebar entry.  Drag the Graceful Sidebar widget to your theme's sidebar.

== Installation ==

1. Upload all the files into your wp-content/plugins directory, be sure to put them into a folder called "graceful_sidebar" - name is important.
1. Activate the plugin at the plugin administration page
1. Use the Graceful Title and Graceful Content edit boxes in the post or page edit screen to supply the content that will display in the sidebar widget only for that post or page.
1. Drag the "Graceful Sidebar" Widget to one of the sidebars in your theme.

Please see the [graceful_sidebar plugin home page](http://mlynn.org/graceful-sidebar-plugin/) for details.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why does the plugin only display a blank title? =
Most likely because you have another plugin in your sidebar that is changing the focus of the current post.  By the time wordpress gets to the task of displaying Graceful Sidebar's content it doesn't know what the current post or page is.
