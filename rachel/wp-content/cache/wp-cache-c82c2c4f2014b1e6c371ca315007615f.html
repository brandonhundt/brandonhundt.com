		<description><![CDATA[Yes, yes I appeared to overlook the automatic qualifier. Here&#039;s what I propose: the hosting Confederation should receive a &#039;Wild Card&#039; to use as they wish. So if two of the three host nations qualify, the third gets in (looking at you Canada). But if all three qualify or only one of three gets in, I imagine that could create some exciting playoff matches for the final spot.

And as much as you like this idea, it doesn&#039;t solve the issue of the Olympics, which has different hosting concerns and different facility concerns. I&#039;m still churning on it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like this idea a lot, more even than the idea of a permanent host. Would this mean doing away with the automatic bid for the host nation(s), given that three or four automatic bids leaves too few to play for?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Semi-agree. Love the list. Would replace the Albanian flag with St Lucia. Find Albania too dark and sinister. Also, think Palau needs a mention. Thanks, very enjoyable]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[New York&#039;s liscence plates are a daily testiment of the boneheads we have elected as governer. The 2010 Gold and Blue hiddeous redesign of our tags was just one part of a rediculous plan by ex-governer Patterson (Who was ironically going blind by the way) to force everyone to re-register our cars. Fourtunatly most of his plan went out the window but unfourtantly the plates stayed. So now there are two types of tags on the street, cars registered before 2010 get to keep the iconic blue and white designs from 2000(which dissapearing) and eveyone else gets screwed with the mix match of blue and gold.

But boy do I miss my old plates. They where blue and white. On the top they had illistrations of Niagra Falls, the Upstate mountain ranges, the Hudson Valley and the skyscrapers of Manhattan with the word&#039;s &quot;THE EMPIRE STATE&quot; written very bold and confidently on the bottom. Gave me something decent to look at while stuck in bumper to bumper traffic on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. I also liked the plates from the 90s where they where just white with the Statue of Liberty in the middle but those days are long gone.]]></description>
