				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been hooked. The first three weeks of this World Cup has featured some of the most brilliant and exciting soccer ever played. However, in the back of my mind I’m still thinking about Qatar hosting a World Cup. Seriously, after watching players struggle to play in the heat and humidity of Brazil, is FIFA still planning on holding a World Cup in the much hotter Qatar? <a href="http://www.thetakeaway.org/story/lawmakers-take-2022-world-cup/">Even after the corrupt voting process</a> where millions of dollars of bribes were used to sway votes to a plan that shouldn’t even been on the table?<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/qatar-world-cup-problems-2014-4"> Even after the known abuses toward a captive migrant workforce</a>?<span id="more-1087"></span></p>
<p>Playing a World Cup in Qatar is a bad idea. The only thing going for it is that its being played in a region that has never hosted a World Cup. John Oliver makes the case better than I do:</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/DlJEt2KU33I" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>I think we are starting to see how the one country, one host philosophy used the vast majority of the time by traveling sporting events, like the World Cup and Olympics, is becoming too outlandish, outdated, and expensive.</p>
<h2>What if FIFA took an outside the box approach to hosting the World Cup?</h2>
<p>From what you hear from FIFA, I think its reasonable clear that they have three major objectives they want to see from the host:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Security of the fans:</strong> They want anybody that travels to the matches to have a good time and be able to come home safely.</li>
<li><strong>Geographic diversity:</strong> This is the opportunity for FIFA to grow the world’s game, so taking it to different parts of the world is still a good idea and part of what makes the World Cup so special.</li>
<li><strong>Ability to host a ton of fans from around the world:</strong> Once again they want to ensure its easy for fans to visit and that they can get tickets. This is where their stadium requirements come in.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are good goals and I don’t think they need to change. I feel they can be achieved through a modified selection process that emphasises the confederations. This is also where I thank my Dutch-born Canadian friend for his discussion on this topic. We figured it out and here’s how it would work:</p>
<p>The five confederations should have greater power in choosing the hosts in a rotating and fair manner. In this method no bidding whatsoever will need to be done. Just like that, the need for bribery is lessened. Here’s how it would work:</p>
<p>Each confederation would choose their hosts from within their Confederation. Yes, I said hosts, plural form. The burden of hosting should not fall on a single nation, but be spread amongst major cities within a continent. In fact, I’d go so far to say that there must be at least three nations used in group stage hosting. This is loosely based on the changes to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2020">Euros that will be in place for their tournament starting in 2020</a>.</p>
<p>This will spread the costs around and allow FIFA to use existing stadiums to host, thus reducing a significant portion of hosting costs and the burden on a single nation.</p>
<p>While travel would appear to go up on the surface, simple changes can be made to group stages so each group can play their matches in a single stadium and city. This will make it easier for fans to attend and ensure each group match is played in similar conditions. The knockout rounds can then start to funnel down to a single group of cities much closer to one another.</p>
<p>It also means that instead of hosting in cities like Manaus, which is in the jungle and has no roads connecting it to the rest of Brazil (and will have an empty stadium after the cup), a CONEMBOL hosted tournament can host matches in Rio, Sao Paulo, Bueno Aires, Montevideo. Places that already have significant infrastructure in place to host. I also think both Montevideo and Buenos Aires are closer to Rio than Manaus and have a better climate too.</p>
<p>Looking at North America, CONCACAF can choose to have a “West Coast World Cup” hosting group stage matches in Mexico City, San Diego, LA, San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, and Vancouver, among others (Phoenix, Guadalajara, Dallas, Calgary, etc).</p>
<p>It also works in Europe, as it will allow major and soccer mad cities like Amsterdam, Brussels, and Copenhagen to host group stage games when typically they come from countries not large enough to singularly host.</p>
<p>The next piece of this is to predetermine a rotation for which confederation hosts. So lets assume FIFA does the right thing and removes the 2022 World Cup from Qatar, it can still be hosted in Asia, and if they wanted in west Asia. Here’s the order I propose, based on previous hosts as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>2018: Russia (the last single nation to host)</li>
<li>2022: AFC (also known as Austral-Asia)</li>
<li>2026: CONCACAF (North America)</li>
<li>2030: UEFA</li>
<li>2034: CAF (Africa)</li>
<li>2038: CONEMBOL (South America)</li>
<li>2042: UEFA (yes, going to Europe every 3rd world cup makes sense)</li>
<li>2046: Assuming the world still exists, this gets repeated.</li>
</ul>
<p>To conclude, this solves the bribery issue and brings down hosting costs for a single nation and spreads out the load a bit. I’m not implying this won’t have challenges, fan visas is one, but I’d rather be discussing that issue in 12 years than the integrity of the beautiful game.</p>
<p>I’ve had my say, now what do you say? Would this work?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You may remember that during London 2012, <a href="http://mindofmaus.wordpress.com">David Kroeker-Maus</a> and I took our <a href="http://rachelbrandon.com/adventures-in-vexillology-the-top-10-best-designed-flags">first adventure in vexillology and ranked our favorite flags</a>. We just couldn&#8217;t let Sochi 2014 come and go without discussing more flags, this time the ones we don&#8217;t particularly care for. But instead of individual rankings, we produced a <a href="http://grantland.com/features/gladwell-vs-simmons-v/">Bill Simmons / Malcolm Gladwell</a> inspired mailbag. We hope you enjoy it&#8230;<span id="more-1069"></span></p>
<p><strong>DAVID:</strong> Okay, let&#8217;s get this started:</p>
<p>You picked the Union Jack as <a href="&lt;http://rachelbrandon.com/adventures-in-vexillology-the-top-10-best-designed-flags/">the best designed flag</a> of any nation-state. It also cracked <a href="http://mindofmaus.wordpress.com/2012/08/13/adventures-in-vexillology-the-top-10-best-symbolic-flags/">my top 10 list</a>. But I think we could both agree that when flags of other countries have the Union Jack in their upper hoist (e.g. Australia, New Zealand, Fiji) that&#8217;s pretty lame, right?</p>
<p><strong>BRANDON:</strong> Absolutely lame. I mean, other commonwealth nations and former colonies have their OWN flags. Canada has their own flag. Uganda has their own flag. Even the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_Isle_of_Man">Isle of Mann</a> has their own flag without a Union Jack and they aren&#8217;t even a country AND much more part of the UK. It just absolutely baffles me that Australia and New Zealand, specifically, don&#8217;t have their own, considering their strong sporting legacy in non-British colours. To me this just feels like a 35 year old who still lets his mum pick out his clothes. Am I wrong here?</p>
<p><strong>DAVID:</strong> Right on. And to further the analogy, Australia and New Zealand are like twins that never developed their own independent personalities, as they both have nearly identical flags, but for the colour of the stars in their Southern Cross.</p>
<p>But you bring up an interesting point about sporting colours, as there are a number of countries that compete in colours not found on their flag. Italy is always in blue and the Netherlands in Orange, for both the Olympics and the World Cup. In the former case, it&#8217;s strange that they pick a colour not on their flag. But in the latter case it&#8217;s the FLAG that&#8217;s missing a colour. I mean, isn&#8217;t the colour orange one of the first three things anyone associates with the Netherlands, along with tulips and windmills?</p>
<p><strong>BRANDON:</strong> Great point, David. Between the Italians and the Dutch, The Netherlands has the most potential for a great flag. Just think if their flag was simply <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=dutch+soccer+jersey&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;imgil=PfI6r8Zu2PUYxM%253A%253Bhttp%253A%252F%252Ft2.gstatic.com%252Fimages%253Fq%253Dtbn%253AANd9GcRbFMY_7kCpBb9_-3oOZqJdqS9m0cpH15jwok2RgHxt673aTIeVIQ%253B600%253B718%253BtbL-LCvqmJ756M%253Bhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.worldsoccershop.com%25252Fshop-by-national-team-netherlands-national-soccer-team.html&amp;source=iu&amp;usg=__H9Fu-DQN9Ps86bes7nH82bFiVqQ%3D&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PAvrUovPLcfuyAHIyIGwCg&amp;ved=0CFcQ9QEwAg&amp;biw=1490&amp;bih=817&amp;dpr=1#facrc=_&amp;imgdii=_&amp;imgrc=Lge0X_wCGdp-gM%253A%3BaKk4v_NPQ0vhEM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.prodirectsoccer.com%252Fus%252Fproductimages%252FV3_1_Main%252F45096.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.prodirectsoccer.com%252Fus%252Flists%252Fholland-soccer-replica-jerseys-kit.aspx%3B570%3B566">the symbol they sport on their soccer kit</a> in black centered on orange. This has top 10 potential and that&#8217;s why their red, white, and blue tricolor disappoints me more than any other flag. On the other hand I expect nothing less from the Italians, and in a sense, if there was only one country that we could grant an exception to in our rankings, I think they would make a strong case as an exception. Red and green is an easy, too easy, stereotype found too often in Italian restaurants and figures like Mario and Luigi. It&#8217;s not flattering.</p>
<p>Fun fact: Japan is also another country that doesn&#8217;t match. They wore blue once and won. They didn&#8217;t win when they switched to red and white, so they decided to go <a href="http://www.kansas.com/2011/07/17/1936597/how-have-previous-johnny-bench.html">back to blue</a>.</p>
<p>But in fairness these flags aren&#8217;t necessarily ugly, they just don&#8217;t seem to completely represent their nations (and I suppose that&#8217;s an easy statement to make as an American. Stars and Stripes FOREVER.) But I&#8217;m curious to find out which flags you find that are just plain ugly?</p>
<p><strong>DAVID:</strong> Ah yes, I had forgotten Japan&#8217;s national football team are even called the &#8216;Blue Samurai.&#8217;</p>
<p>You&#8217;re the designer so I&#8217;ll leave the question of which flags are plain &#8216;ugly&#8217; to you. I would say that there are some flags that, whilst not necessarily aesthetically deficient, are just off-putting. The most obvious example would be the flag of Mozambique. Putting an AK-47 on your flag isn&#8217;t really a good look for anyone, especially when the only association most of the world can make with your country is &#8216;civil war.&#8217; I suppose maybe they get points for accurate representation, but I think your flag should represent your country&#8217;s aspirations, not just its grim realities.</p>
<p>So what say ye? Are there any flags that rub you the wrong way as a designer?</p>
<p><strong>BRANDON:</strong> It&#8217;s funny you mention civil war as a cause for some odd flag choices, because one of my least favorite flags comes another country in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/25/catherine-samba-panza-central-african-republic">a civil war</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_the_Central_African_Republic.svg">Central African Republic</a>. The flag just has a weird pattern, too many colors, and a weirdly placed star. At the same time its hard for me to rip into their flag because its like picking on someone who just doesn&#8217;t need to be picked on right now. The French already pick on them enough. Seriously, I just learned today of what amounts to a French Colonial tax that&#8217;s still imposed on France&#8217;s former African colonies. It&#8217;s no wonder the flag isn&#8217;t great, the French probably imposed it on them as a penalty for independence.</p>
<p>Before I get into other ugly flags, I noticed we both included a &#8220;weaponized&#8221; flag in our top 10s. I had Saudi Arabia and its very sharp sword at #2. And your #1 ranked flag included a trident (Barbados) albiet a broken one. And there are many many more that include them but in different ways. Are you implying that there is a classification system for &#8220;weaponized flags&#8221;? That some weapons are more &#8220;flag worthy&#8221; than others? Based on this, how do you classify Kenya&#8217;s flag, is it capable of representing the aspirations of a nation? And also looking at the &#8220;weaponized flags&#8221; all but a couple are either from Africa or the Middle East. Is this concerning?</p>
<p><strong>DAVID:</strong> Yes, colonialism is alive and well, although I hadn&#8217;t realised until I read that article how old-school it is in the Françafrique. But yeah, weird flag for the CAR.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve kinda caught me out on this weaponised flag question. Whilst I admit I&#8217;m a bit of an old-fashioned traditionalist, this alone doesn&#8217;t explain my preference for the spears and shield of Kenya (or Swaziland) to the AK-47 of Mozambique. Here&#8217;s my defence:</p>
<p>Most flags, when you think about it, imply some sort of violence; many use the colour red to signify blood shed in this or that national struggle, and many, including the ones you mention above, feature some sort of traditional or indigenous weaponry to represent the country&#8217;s history and culture. But there&#8217;s something to be said for subtlety and representation.</p>
<p>To take a slightly different angle, countries that just write their name on their flag (eg Paraguay) or have acompletely literal map of their country (eg Cyprus) will never get my vote over a flag with anational symbol that is almostsynonymous with the country itself (e.g. Canada) or a clever, well-thought-out but still simple depiction of the country&#8217;s geography (eg Brazil, obviously!). I guess for that same reason, I&#8217;m more sympathetic to Barbados&#8217; broken trident, with all its&#8217; powerful symbolism, or Oman&#8217;s khanjar daggers, with their reference to ancient customs and traditions, than to Mozambique&#8217;s very blunt and straightforward depiction of their brutal civil war in the 70s, 80s and 90s.</p>
<p>In short, I prefer Van Gogh to Rembrandt.</p>
<p><strong>BRANDON:</strong> Catching you off guard? I&#8217;ll take that as a back-handed compliment, consider your answer satisfactory (when in fact its more than) and I&#8217;ll use your reference to Van Gogh and Rembrandt to segue.</p>
<p>It is undisputed that Van Gogh and Rembrandt are legendary painters. You may prefer one to the other, but you can still appreciate the other&#8217;s works. This is not the case with Thomas Kincaid. He paints kitch, meaning his work lacks meaning and is overly commercial. He is despised by the art community while his paintings sell like hot cakes. I guess what I&#8217;m getting at are there any flags that you feel are overrated?</p>
<p>And for the record, I&#8217;m punting.</p>
<p><strong>DAVID:</strong> Your punt is acceptable, as I believe you more or less said the Star-Spangled Banner was overrated in your first flag post, eh?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bit difficult to call any particular flag overrated, as no one seems to get as worked up about flags as I do (although I discovered last night that Sheldon Cooper claims to. Nevertheless, here are a few things that are generally overdone in flags:</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/zDn5IlHqlA4" height="315" width="420" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>1. <strong>Red, white and blue</strong>. Someone actually did a <a href="https://flagspot.net/flags/xf-csts.html">statistical analysis</a> on colour frequency and area cover on national flags and, no surprise, this is the most popular combination. Apparently the UN flag should have been done up in red, white and blue, as countries everywhere seem to love it!</p>
<p>2. <strong>Lions</strong>. Okay, there&#8217;s only a handful of countries that do this, but c&#8217;mon! If Tanzania or Kenya wanted to put a lion on their flag, that would make sense. But <a href="http://flags.net/FIJI.htm">Fiji</a>? A few lions would quickly devastate most of their islands. And sure, lions probably ONCE roamed Spain, but shouldn&#8217;t the monarchy be bothered that their representation on the country&#8217;s flag is an animal that the country hunted to extinction?</p>
<p>Finally, a flag pun: What does the pink lion on Spain&#8217;s flag represent? Pride.</p>
<p>Do you have any general flag pet peeves?</p>
<p><strong>BRANDON:</strong> A few follow up items before getting to your question:</p>
<p>Interesting you link to a clip from The Big Bang Theory in the same paragraph you used the word overrated, because it is the most overrated situational comedy on television at the moment #justsayin. However, I do give them some credit for working the word vexillology into primetime.</p>
<p>The statistical analysis you provided would make my ugliest websites list, hands down.<br />
Props to Tanzania for having no red or lions in their flag, but having strong cases to include both.<br />
Perhaps my biggest pet peeve in flag design is when triangles and stars get out of control, together. I have two examples: and</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_the_Marshall_Islands.svg">The Marshall Islands</a>: The bands (another obvious equator reference), don&#8217;t go corner to corner making them off-putting. It also appears that they are supposed to imply a sense of depth perception that is not realized. Then the star&#8230; ouch. There&#8217;s no cohesive feel to the banner. I should also mention that the flag was designed by the first first lady of the Marshall Islands. It suppose her husband didn&#8217;t have the heart to tell her he didn&#8217;t like it #cheapshot.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina.svg">Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina</a>: Here&#8217;s another nation torn by competing ethnic groups with a history of civil strife. In fact this flag was imposed on the nation by the UN high representative at the time, a Spaniard. The flag has its issues, mainly: 1) obnoxiously large stars; 2) the use of a right triangle that&#8217;s not bound to the hoist. I just want to push it over. Seriously.. just nudge it over, or change the orientation of the triangle so it looks grounded and not divided.</p>
<p>Have we covered it all the things wrong with world flags? Should we move to closing statements? Or better yet how does one wrap up a joint mailbag post?</p>
<p><strong>DAVID:</strong> Hmm, I&#8217;m not quite sure how to wrap this up. How about this: You&#8217;ve just opened a flag re-design consultancy &#8212; a startup with limited staff and resources. Which one flag redesign project would you take on? It may not necessarily be the one you like the least &#8212; just the one you&#8217;d be most keen to redesign.</p>
<p><strong>BRANDON:</strong> Ooh, I&#8217;d start by redesigning Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Netherlands. Follow that with Australia and New Zealand. Then onto the CAR and Marshall Islands. Shall we find a grant to apply for? Shall we kickstarter?</p>
<p>I think we wrap up by sincerely thanking each other, plugging the other&#8217;s projects, and asking for reader suggestions.</p>
<p>Thank you David, this has been fun and informative and you have my sincerest gratitude for your participation as you are a busy man now writing for the esteemed <a href="http://bit.ly/1g2fCJU">Salt Collective</a>, among other places. I look forward to our next endeavor.</p>
<p>And for those readers that have stuck with us this far, please do chime in with your snubs from this list or a passioned plea in the patriotic defense of your home nations banner&#8217;s inclusion in this list.</p>
<p><strong>DAVID:</strong> Well, as always Brandon, it&#8217;s been a pleasure blogging with you, especially on matters of such great import. Hopefully we&#8217;ll do another joint post before these Olympics are over!</p>
<p>Also, I&#8217;m very much looking forward to the upcoming launch of your sports (and other competitions) reform blog!</p>
<p>Finally, sorry to everyone we&#8217;ve offended! Hopefully you&#8217;ll still feel a sense of pride when you see your flag being hoisted to the rafters as your national anthem plays and one of your country&#8217;s finest athletes receives a gold medal.</p>
<p>Unless of course you&#8217;re from the Marshall Islands, in which case, just, sorry.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Julio is a American from Alabama. He just received his Masters in Engineering, tops in his class, from MIT. But this year, the top 100 engineering firms got together and selected one by one candidates to fill their available positions. It ensured that engineering talent was properly spread out around the country and decreased costs on the hiring process. The companies also determined that the underperforming firms would get to choose their candidates first.<span id="more-1059"></span></p>
<p>Those that weren’t selected or didn’t agree to a position, wouldn’t get a job in engineering this year and would have to go through the process again next year. Julio was honored to be chosen 2nd overall, because because he worked really hard to achieve high scores in school. But he didn’t like the company that selected him. In his mind, they weren’t a good personality fit and they had large debts. They were also located in Nome, Alaska.</p>
<p>Friends, clearly, this is not a true story. This couldn&#8217;t happen in America, it feels fundamentally un-American.</p>
<p>But it does happen.</p>
<p>Its called the professional sports draft, and all the major North American sport leagues have them and are the only leagues in the world that I know of that have them.</p>
<p>AND here’s the kicker, the general American public not only accepts the draft, they look forward to it. This strikes me as odd. Because I can also safely assume that the American public wouldn’t accept the Engineering draft I described above.</p>
<p>This, my friends, is what this post is about. The hypocrisy between a country&#8217;s political viewpoints and how its sports leagues are run. Because its not only an American thing.</p>
<p>Let’s take a simple quiz.</p>
<p>I will list a word that sports leagues use around the world to describe their philosophy for how teams can acquire athletes. First, we will determine which words 1) sound more capitalistic (i.e. lightly regulated free market) or 2) sound more socialistic (regulated market where the goal is to level the field).</p>
<p><em>(NOTE: I’m not advocating for either system. I’m not saying socialism is better than capitalism or vise versa. This is simply an observation I’ve made between how citizens cheer for teams one way and then turn around and vote another way.)</em></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Draft: </b>The draft is a process where new players coming into the league are selected by teams. Players have no say in where they end up, if they want to play in the league (John Elway and Eli Manning the exceptions). The draft order is usually determined by the worst team from the previous season getting the first pick. In other words, the last shall be first and the first shall be last. This is a socialistic philosophy.</li>
<li><b>Salary Cap: </b>This is a league dictated maximum payroll teams are allowed to spend on players. It’s intended to stop the big teams from vastly outspending the smaller ones and keep a financially fair field. Another clear socialistic sounding philosophy.</li>
<li><b>Luxury Tax:</b> This is a method used when leagues don’t want to impose a hard salary cap, but want to slow down some teams spending. The tax is issued when the team exceeds a certain amount, and the tax is paid back to teams below the tax threshold. If I remember the last U.S. Presidential campaign correctly, taxing the rich equals fascism or was it socialism or was it both? I’ll call this socialism to be safe.</li>
<li><b>Revenue Sharing: </b>This is when the top earning teams pay the lesser earning teams to maintain a competitive balance and ensure the bottom feeders can be profitable. You guessed it, Socialism!</li>
<li><b>Relegation:</b> If your team finishes in the bottom three at the end of the season you lose your spot in the league. The successful continue, the losers are out. Capitalism.</li>
<li><b>Promotion</b>: If your team finishes in the top three of your league you get to move up to the next league. Increasing your status by pulling up your bootstraps. Capitalism.</li>
<li><b>Posting Fees: </b>A team has put you on the auction block. If you sign with an another team, the team that signed you needs to pay the team you left a set fee. This type of dealing is common in Capitalism.</li>
<li><b>Selling: </b>Similar to posting fees, this is when a player wishes to move on or their current team wants a player to move on, but they are still under contract. The two teams then negotiate a fee to be paid to the selling team. A fair transaction at market prices. Capitalism.</li>
<li><b>Loans: </b>When players aren’t getting a lot of playing time, they are often “loaned” to another team for a set period of time. This leans more Capitalistic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let&#8217;s go back over this list to determine which of these terms are more common to North American Sports Leagues or European Sports Leagues:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Draft (socialist): </b>North America</li>
<li><b>Salary Cap (socialist): </b>North America</li>
<li><b>Luxury Tax (socialist):</b> North America</li>
<li><b>Revenue Sharing (socialist): </b>North America</li>
<li><b>Relegation (capitalist):</b> Europe</li>
<li><b>Promotion (capitalist)</b>: Europe</li>
<li><b>Posting Fees (capitalist): </b>Europe</li>
<li><b>Selling (capitalist): </b>Europe</li>
<li><b>Loans (capitalist): </b>Europe</li>
</ul>
<p>Surprisingly, North American sports leagues have more of a socialist leaning in economic philosophies despite the regions (or at least the U.S.’s) political propensity towards ‘freedom’ at all and any cost.</p>
<p>AND the European leagues have more of a cutthroat method of competition (losing a spot in a league is a tough pill to swallow) but they allow for easier movement of players to locations players want to go while their governments look for ways to ensure their citizens are well taken care of.</p>
<p>At a grander level, I think it shows that there are institutions important to citizens that are showing the rest of their country that maybe some preconceived notions towards a political philosophy may be ignorant at best. And that maybe we should take a deeper look at the economics of sports leagues to determine which are going to be healthier in the long run, so that parallels can be made at the political level.</p>
<p>I guess what I’m attempting to say is that sports aren’t people. Sports may prick our pride, or give us joy for a moment, but they don’t affect (or at least shouldn’t affect) our mental and physical health. Therefore, we should use sports as an economic testing ground, much like scientists (rightly or wrongly) use rats, monkeys, and pigs to study human health, to help study the cause and affect certain policies have on the economic well being of a league and thusly a nation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/22/sports/football/nfl-roundup.html?_r=0" rel="external">extra point is now pointless</a>, according to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. Being someone that is typically <a href="http://rachelbrandon.com/tag/sports-reform/" rel="external">pro rule change</a> this is music to my ears. However, Goodell’s proposal  just feels wrong. Here it is summed up: A touchdown is automatically worth 7 points, unless the scoring teams attempts to run an additional play for an attempt at an additional point, but if that play is unsuccessful you lose a point. Please try to explain that to a non-football fan. It would just add to an increasingly confusing and over regulated rule book.</p>
<p><span id="more-1046"></span></p>
<p>On a related tangent, it always surprises me that Americans (in the most stereotypical connotation of the word) love their version of football even though it is highly regulated and controlled. There are many rules that favor parity and financial fair play, and there’s also a draft system that assigns players to places they’d probably rather not go if they had the choice (i.e. Cleveland). If you were to compare the NFL to any government/economic system, wouldn’t it most parallel European Socialism? This doesn’t sound very free-market / democratic / capitalistic to me. <em>Spoiler Alert: This may end up being another post down the road. [UPDATE: <a href="http://rachelbrandon.com/the-hypocrisy-between-a-countrys-political-philosophy-and-how-its-sports-leagues-are-run/" rel="external">IT IS NOW.</a>]</em></p>
<p>Back to the issue at hand, I like that Goodell is thinking outside the box for a rule change to the PAT, but any change to the rule should include football. Let’s look to rugby, American football’s predecessor, for a solution.</p>
<p>In rugby union, the equivalent to a touchdown is called a ‘try’. It is worth 5 points. A player is awarded a try when they physically touch down the ball in the equivalent to the end zone.</p>
<p>On another side note, in rugby, the defensive team can still take the ball away from an offensive player in the end zone, until it has been touched down to the ground in a controlled fashion. This is also in contrast to the NFL’s most hypocritical rule, that a ball carrier can simply ‘break the plane of the end zone’ without maintaining control through the end of the play to score a touchdown; in contrast to a pass catcher that needs to get two feet in the end zone, make a ‘play typical to the game of football&#8217; and maintain control through the process of the catch. Hows that for some highly regulated inconsistency.</p>
<p>Back to rugby. As soon as the ‘try’ is awarded, a kick is then attempted from anywhere behind the spot of where the try was scored. In other terms, if you scored right in between the uprights the player gets to attempt a straight on kick. Score in the corner, the kick becomes more difficult. You miss the kick, its no points. You make it, its two points. <a href="http://thepowerofgoals.blogspot.com/2013/01/rating-rugby-union-kickers-by-kick.html" rel="external">It’s by no means automatic</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example of a conversion from the corner:</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/dC7EyUtEASA" height="315" width="420" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Adapting this for the NFL fairly straight forward, if we ignore the hashmarks where plays are rule bound to start. What I recommend, is that for the sake of the extra point or two point conversion is that the play, like rugby, will start from where the touchdown is scored or from 10 yards into the field from the sideline, which ever is closer to the center of the field (or typically where the yardage numbers are located). The team can either run the play from the 2 yard line or voluntarily move the ball backwards as far back as they want to go to attempt to improve the kicking angle.</p>
<p>I can see many benefits to this rule change.</p>
<ul>
<li>The extra point isn’t automatic, and any additional points are earned and not just given.</li>
<li>Play calling from short yardage would change, as coaches would have incentive to score closer to the center of the field.</li>
<li>If a touchdown is scored in the corner of the end zone, I would assume more coaches would attempt a 2pt conversion from that spot, as it may be the less risky option. This increases excitement.</li>
<li>I’d also like to see the formations developed when a team has 40 yards of open space to one side.</li>
<li>With Goodell’s interest in drawing English fans (and the potential of a London franchise), this is a rule English fans would recognize from rugby.</li>
</ul>
<p>You’re welcome Roger. Thanks for getting the conversation started. Please let me know what you think of this rule proposal.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For an organization that is against match fixing of matches, it is ironic that FIFA uses ping pong balls to determine the placement of teams into eight groups for the worlds most important sporting event. It just shows a general lack of common sense and lack of will. There’s just too much on the line to run a lottery, especially when an easy and fair approach is so obvious.<span id="more-1030"></span></p>
<p>Being a fan of the USMNT, it would be easy for me to sound off on my they were screwed by the aforementioned ping pong balls. But I don’t want to this to sound like sour grapes. So I am going to use other teams scenarios as justification for the stupidity of the draw:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both Spain and the Netherlands (champion and runner-up four years ago) didn’t lose a match in their final qualifying groups. Their reward? They drew each other in the same group with a tough Chile team.</li>
<li>France got off easy. With the way France “represented” themselves in the last World Cup, and how they needed a desperate win down two goals to even qualify (to their credit they did), they deserved a tougher group and NOT a free pass into the top 16.</li>
<li>Ghana deserved better. Being one of the top teams in qualifying from Africa and one of the better historic African performers at the World Cup, they didn’t deserve their draw.  Just look at their group. They got two top 5 world-ranked European teams and the CONCACAF top qualifier. That doesn’t seem right by any standard, especially when Cameroon, the lowest ranked African qualifier drew an easier (but not easy) group.</li>
<li>Of note, the most difficult group has an average ranking of (as determined by the FIFA rankings): 11.25. The lowest ranking is: 28.25. That&#8217;s 17 spots. A serious disparity.</li>
</ul>
<p>To sum up, the draw doesn’t take into account how a team got there, but its based simply on which confederation they belong to. Fortunately there is an easy solution I will now over explain.</p>
<p>Seed the teams 1-32 based on the FIFA World Cup Rankings, while ensuring groups are geographically diverse.</p>
<p>The criteria explained:</p>
<p><b>1. <a title="FIFA World Cup Rankings" href="http://www.fifa.com/worldranking/rankingtable/" rel="external">The FIFA World Cup Rankings</a></b><a title="FIFA World Cup Rankings" href="http://www.fifa.com/worldranking/rankingtable/" target="_blank"><b>:</b> </a>While no ranking system is perfect, this one is pretty good. It takes into account the qualification process, confederation tournaments, and friendlies. They are mostly accepted by world football too, that helps. <b><i>Side note:</i></b> If World Cup seeding was partially determined by the results of friendly matches, it would help friendlies to become more important. An unintended bonus!</p>
<p><b>2. Geographic Diversity: </b>Continue the tradition of having no other teams from your confederation in your group, unless you are from Europe, then there should be no more than two. This is an important element of it being the World Cup.</p>
<p>With criteria in place, let’s just rank the teams, starting with #1 (Spain) through number 8 (the Swiss) and slot them in groups A to H. Then in the second round take the next group and slot them in H to A. So the #9 team (Netherlands) is placed with the Swiss. Then we go A to H, then H to A. So the top team and the bottom team are placed into the same group.</p>
<p>This is not rocket science.</p>
<p>The only catch is ensuring geographic diversity. The first conflict came with placing #20 Mexico, who would have been placed with the USA (the irony!), so I moved Mexico down, and filled in the open slot with the next ranked team (Bosnia-Herzegovina). Surprisingly, this only happened three times (as noted by the asterisks).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how the final results would look:</p>
<p>A: Spain (1), Croatia (16), Côte d’Ivoire (17), Australia (58)<br />
B: Germany (2), Chile (15), France (19), South Korea (54)<br />
C: Argentina (3), USA (14), Bosnia-Herzegovina* (21), Cameroon (51)<br />
D: Colombia (4), England (13), Mexico* (20), Japan (48)<br />
E: Portugal (5), Greece (12), Ecuador** (23), Iran (45)<b> </b><br />
F: Uruguay (6), Belgium (11), Russia** (22), Nigeria (36)***:<br />
G: Italy (7), Brazil (10), Ghana (24), Honduras (41)***<br />
H: Switzerland (8), Netherlands (9), Algeria (26), Costa Rica (31)</p>
<p>These groups are fair and balanced leading to a great competition! Proof is that the average rankings of the groups falls between 18.75 and 23. That’s only five spots. So no group can be considered easy, and no group can claim to be that much harder than the others.</p>
<p>Remember that with the current draw the spread was 11.25-28.25 or 17 spots and it hit teams randomly!! Giving the 11th ranked Belgians the easiest group and the 2nd ranked Germans the hardest. My seeding gave Spain, Germany, and Argentina slightly easier groups with the #8 Swiss getting a slightly harder group, but this is the way it should be.</p>
<p>To conclude, <a title="Contact FIFA about this post!" href="http://www.fifa.com/contact/form.html" rel="external">FIFA has a contact form that asks for ‘Feedback on National teams’ Fixtures and Results’</a>. Let’s use it, send them the link to this post.</p>
<p>I’d enjoy hearing your thoughts below, but I leave you with this method for destroying the ping pong balls once and for all:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thankfully this is the final year of the BCS in college football. However, the system being put in place is still prone to controversy. Only four teams will be in a playoff decided upon by a committee, leaving many potentially worthy teams out. While the new playoff system is better than the BCS, it is not bulletproof. College football needs to be able to crown a champion that is undisputed. Here&#8217;s how.<span id="more-1012"></span></p>
<p>I have devised a system that will produce an undisputed champion AND solve many of college football&#8217;s issues: Competitive imbalance, ever-shifting conference realignment, a true national champion, all the while maintaining the many of the rivalries that fans seem to cherish. Oh, and it will make a lot of money for schools.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s five steps. At the end of this, you&#8217;ll be like,</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;This format makes too much sense.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<h2>Step: 1: One last conference realignment to rule them all.</h2>
<p>Quite honestly, this is the hardest step because people will be stubborn and greedy and petty, because what needs to happen is an unemotional division of teams based on geographic distance. What my system requires are eight balanced conferences consisting of 12 teams each based on region. This then creates a pool of 96 teams that start the season in contention for the National Championship.</p>
<p>The chart below shows how I would split them up based on the following rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you put the schools from a conference on a map, there can&#8217;t be any geographic outliers, like there are now. You can&#8217;t jump over one school to place it with another. So West Virginia will not be with teams in Texas, like they are now.</li>
<li>All schools from the same state should be in the same conference. This preserves rivalries, like Auburn and Alabama, Iowa and Iowa St, and Texas and Texas A&amp;M. I managed this in all cases except for the state of Tennessee (Memphis). I don&#8217;t think we are losing much here.</li>
<li>Preserve<i> exceptional </i>outstate<i> </i>rivalries, so long as it doesn&#8217;t violate steps 1&amp;2: Mainly: Army vs. Navy, Michigan vs. Ohio State.</li>

<p><i>Note: </i>Schools were determined by 2013 conference alignment. It includes all teams from the SEC, ACC, Big 10, Big 12, Pac 12, Mountain West and American (Big East). Then it takes 4 independents (Notre Dame, BYU, Navy, Army), and adds a few of the more successful teams from the MAC, Sun Belt, and Conference USA to round it out based on region. What you have are 8 competitively balanced conferences with powerhouses and minnows spread out amongst them.</p>
<h2>Step 2: Scheduling</h2>
<p>Every team&#8217;s season would consist of 11 games against the 11 other teams in their conference. Since there are an odd number of games, each team will get to have 5 home games and 5 road games, with one neutral site game that the two schools involved can take anywhere they&#8217;d like. Neutral site games bring in the bling.</p>
<p>Games would start the first Saturday of September and proceed for 11 weeks. The final week of the season would be the third week of November.</p>
<h2>Step 3: Conference Championships</h2>
<p>The top two teams from each conference will meet in their conference&#8217;s championship game. The winner goes to the playoffs. This is essentially round 1 of a sixteen team playoff. Also, another lucrative caveat based on the schedule above, this game can be played Thanksgiving weekend Saturday. This will give fans and bands a chance to travel.</p>
<h2>Step 4: The Playoffs</h2>
<p>The eight winners of each conference championship game go to the playoffs. Each team will be placed in a regional vs another nearby region. The same seeding would be used each year, with the venue (an NFL stadium) alternating between the two regions each year. This will make for an easy to follow format. If you think your team has a good team, you can pre-book your trip(s).</p>
<p><i>Round 1: (2nd weekend December)</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Northwest vs Southwest</li>
<li>South Central vs North Central</li>
<li>Midwest vs NorthEast</li>
<li>Mid South vs South East</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Round 2: (New Years Day)</i></p>
<ul>
<li>West Championship (NW/SW vs. SC/NC)</li>
<li>East Championship (MW/NE vs. MS/SE)</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Championship: (2nd week January)</i></p>
<ul>
<li>East Champ vs West Champ</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 5: Count the Cash&#8230;</h2>
<p>… and pay the players.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it and not one ounce of human opinion is required. Please <a href="http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/">write your Congressman</a> and let them know about this system so they can put pressure on the NCAA, like they did to rid the BCS. I can&#8217;t think of a better way to do this. Can you? If so, chime in below.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every year NFL games seem to get longer and longer. Most take three to three and a half real hours to play 60 minutes of actual game. So lets pick up the pace a bit by setting a goal to have games played in a 2.5 hour window. Here&#8217;s how:<span id="more-996"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_998" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://rachelbrandon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2725990219_ff1ce81137_n.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-998" alt="Teams even practice huddling. Credit: http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernzilla/2725990219/" src="http://rachelbrandon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2725990219_ff1ce81137_n-300x198.jpg" width="300" height="198" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A team practices huddling. Good form boys. <em>Credit: http://www.flickr.com/photos/bernzilla/2725990219/</em></p></div>
<p>#1: <strong>Ban the huddle&#8230;</strong><br />
&#8230;unless coming out of a timeout or at the beginning of a drive. These are professional athletes, they don&#8217;t need to huddle after every play. There are already teams with really good offenses doing this (NE, Denver, Philly to name three). It&#8217;s time to have all teams do this.</p>
<p>#2: <strong>Shorten the play clock to 28 seconds</strong>.<br />
With the huddle banned this is a natural. The Chip Kelly Eagles are snapping every 20 seconds (and want to go faster) and the Pats every 22-24. Is the league worse off for this? I say no. They&#8217;ve doubled the number of offense snaps per game. More bang for the ever increasing buck!</p>
<p>*One of the intended benefits of faster play is that teams would no longer be able to field 400 pounders because they won&#8217;t be able to keep up. Simply put, the players will be healthier for the extra running, and this may actually help to promote a healthier lifestyle for Americans.</p>
<p>#3: If a team goes 3 and out, a commercial break should not be taken. If your offense sucks, fans shouldn&#8217;t have to suffer from sitting through the tenth repeat of a Buffalo Wild Wings commercial in the first quarter of a game. Therefore, I recommend the following changes: <strong>two commercial breaks per quarter, one in between each quarter and two at halftime.</strong> That is 12 breaks (10 more than a soccer match) and should still be enough to only see that B-dub&#8217;s commercial six times.</p>
<h2>Bonus Rule:</h2>
<div id="attachment_1000" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://rachelbrandon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/6274195289_5b174a1cd8.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1000" alt="Ahem....

Credit: http://www.flickr.com/photos/marianne_oleary/6274195289</p></div>
<p><strong>Ban coach to QB electronic devices.</strong><br />
In no other sport do coaches influence the game more than in football. This is fine if your team has a good coach, but there are way too many who are egomaniacal micromanagers who can&#8217;t give up control*. Let&#8217;s let the players play. NFL QBs should be able to call the plays for the team. I&#8217;m not saying coaches can&#8217;t call plays, but lets make it more difficult.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<h2>And one more thought:</h2>
<p>This week, Big 10 Commissioner Jim Delaney came out and offered his full support to the ideals of amateurism by exclaiming that <a href="http://espn.go.com/college-sports/story/_/id/9723411/big-ten-commissioner-jim-delany-discusses-possible-football-basketball-changes" rel="external">he doesn&#8217;t feel the NCAA should be the minor leagues for the NFL and NBA</a>. He said if a player wants to go pro let them, just like the way it is in baseball and golf. You know what, he&#8217;s right.</p>
<p>If you are a loyal reader of mine, you know I&#8217;ve long <a href="http://rachelbrandon.com/tag/sports-reform/">been advocating for a professional model towards sports in America</a>, so I was pleased to hear his candor. He seems to be admitting that any which way the NCAA tries to semi-professionalize, it will not work and will look like a joke (because the NCAA is a joke).</p>
<p>This is why I think the NBA and NFL should pounce on this opportunity by taking Delaney up on his offer and start serious second divisions. And not the kind of second division that top division teams affiliate with lower division teams (aka baseball and hockey) but second division teams that have a chance to make the jump to the first division. Read <a href="/redrawing-ncaa-college-football-the-end-of-the-amateur-ideal/">this</a>, <a href="/part-1-saving-american-basketball/">this</a>, <a href="/part-2-better-basketball-professional-club-teams/">this</a>, or <a href="/the-world-basketball-cup-a-tournament-to-save-the-nba/">this</a> for more thoughts on the topic.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>How do you feel about the proposed rule changes? Chime in by commenting below.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the end of August rolls around, I am really tiring of the heat. I begin to look forward to fall, the season of light jackets, turning leaves, local football, sweatshirts, and the next season of <em>Survivor</em>. Most of all, I’m looking forward to the newness that the new school year brings.<span id="more-986"></span></p>
<p>This is, of course a very optimistic way of looking at the “back to school” reality, as I’d like to acknowledge this assumption (accurate or not) that for every excited kindergartener counting down the days until they can use a backpack, there are two or three students who are dreading going back to school for a plethora of valid of reasons.</p>
<p>Also the reality that many teachers probably have mixed emotions about returning to the classroom after a few (very quick) months, or weeks of freedom and, hopefully, rest and rejuvenation.</p>
<p>I myself am preparing to start my third year of grad school this fall, in fact, I believe my first paper is due in exactly one week, so as soon as I’m done blogging and doing the dishes (I mean, helping my husband do the dishes!) I’ll get to work on reading.</p>
<p>However, this year is quite different for me since I’ve left my post of five years as a Student Affairs professional at a local private liberal arts college and am, by society’s standards, unemployed at the moment. ; )</p>
<p>August has not had the same rush and anxious preparatory feel as it usually does. (I’d like to say that its been more relaxing, except that my main responsibility this last month has instead been one artistic, dramatic, developing, lively and lovely toddler instead of 200 college freshmen… and so far, I’m not convinced which August life is less relaxing. More on that later perhaps.)</p>
<p>In spite of the fact that my August is drastically different than the previous five, it has triggered some thought about what this time of year brings with it for all involved: students (of all ages), parents, teachers, schools, etc. And so, I’d like to take a moment to cheer for those more involved than I find myself at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>I’d like to cheer on the teachers,</strong> those fresh and veteran, those excited and hopeful, and those who are dreading the same old challenges that come with every new school year and with some students in particular that seem too heavy and complex to care about for too long.</p>
<p><strong>I’d like to cheer on the parents,</strong> those teary-eyed and confused at where the time has gone as they watch their son or daughter off to school for the very first time, and those looking forward for the change of pace (might I offer the word, “balance”?) that comes with having their kids in school for six or so hours a day and the family back to its normal routine.</p>
<p><strong>And I’d like to cheer on the students.</strong> Being a student can be really hard, its true. But press on dear student because the challenges that you work through now will prepare you for even bigger ones later in your life. But also, don’t be afraid to ask for help. Asking for help is one of the best learning methods out there, and it allows others to support you. You weren’t meant to go about life on your own, so therefore, learning should not be such a strictly individual pursuit.</p>
<p>I cheer us all on! And in fact, at the risk of sounding corny, I’d like to inspire all of us to approach this new year (or to those of you not impacted by the academic calendar, the rest of the year) with the mindset that we all can be “life-long learners”. Learning is not something we do simply to get a degree in hopes of a better paying job, it is something we do all the time, whether we’re learning to be more apathetic about our own learning or active.</p>
<p>Let’s try to learn new things, whether it be having an open mind in a conversation with a colleague at work, figuring out how to best remodel your kitchen (oh how I’d LOVE to remodel my kitchen!), reading a new genre of book, perhaps reading a book at all, making new friends with different types of people, how to ask better questions in conversations, trying a new food or a new diet, redoing your budget… The possibilities for learning are endless! They must be taken advantage of though, so please do!</p>
<p>Switching gears, one of my “learning” goals this year has been to take something that I love to do and do something with it… you know, out there, out of my comfort zone. So, a few months ago, I opened an <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/HeraldandHighlight" title="Herald and Highlight Digital Prints and Posters">Etsy shop that sells digital posters and prints</a> that I’ve been creating. There’s so much to learn about: new Illustrator techniques, internet marketing, SEO, copyright stuff, social networking (supposedly it would be a good idea to get a twitter account and USE it), blah!</p>
<p>While these are just a few examples that show just how intimidating learning can be, nevertheless, I’ve decided to take it in stride and admit there’s a learning curve to everything new, and take my best stab at it. I’d love for you to check it out, offer comments even! : )</p>
<ul>
<li>What are new things you’re learning this year?</li>
<li>How do you pursue learning on a day to day basis?</li>
<li>I know I didn’t mention this here in this particular blog, but If you are religious, how do you see learning as a spiritual exercise or discipline?</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m just getting back from DrupalCon in the so weird it ceases to be weird city of Portland, Oregon. Here are the major points I got out of it with links to a few sessions:<span id="more-975"></span></p>
<ol>
<li>Let&#8217;s not bury the lead and get right to it: Content is killing the CMS. I didn&#8217;t hear these exact words used at the conference, but I felt the message was clear. More below.</li>
<li>Drupal 8 is sweet. Did I just hear that D8 will create mobile apps? More Below&#8230;</li>
<li>There is more than one way to eat a Reese&#8217;s when it comes to the Design Process or UX. I spent a lot lot of time in UX centered sessions and each presenter seemed to have a different process or workflow, and each offered good techniques and sound theory. Therefore, I recommend you <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA7g9oAIkZg">watch this session</a>, but only if have an hour to waste, and have watched the other sessions listed in here first. Or feel free to watch the session first and then you will understand why I am speaking in contradictions and circles. That is enough about this.</li>
<li>My informal study has concluded that Portland Timbers logos out number Trailblazer logos like 3 to 1. Unfortunately, no games were in town on my trip.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Point 1: Content is killing the CMS</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been paying attention to the greater web community over the past few years you will have read your fair share of articles about responsive design and the strategy known as mobile first. So popular in fact, it was the underlying theme of DrupalCon Denver. They are effective and popular techniques to try to pry the internet out of the concept of pixel perfection.</p>
<p>Then along came Karen McGrane&#8217;s keynote. (NOTE: You can watch all of the keynotes <a href="http://portland2013.drupal.org/live">at this link</a> and you should watch this one.) While she did not say it directly, she made an argument that the mobile first strategy is not enough. I don&#8217;t want to understate the importance of mobile, but a mobile website is simply one device and display in a multi-device world.</p>
<p>Think of all of the places where digital content now exist (or will exist in the next few years: desktops, phones, tablets, phablets, TVs, Xboxes, Google Glass, watches, refrigerators, and digital signage. What will happen to your content when it is read to a user by an automated voice while they are driving a car?</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s important to remember that the number of mobile users is growing every day and its important not to neglect them (i.e. mobile first), it is not enough. Not every device mention above is mobile. Different devices require a different experiences.</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s terms, I only need to look at my organizations needs. Our content is delivered to multiple apps and devices including: radio stations, desktop site, mobile site, mobile app, iTunes, Google Currents, Flipboard, Pulse, and multiple RSS feeds. All of these devices have different displays and content needs.</p>
<p>It is not enough to simply add some content in a WYSIWYG body field, hit save, and ensure it looks good on the desktop page. Content needs to have the ability to flex. Meaning there needs to be one spot (or system) where all of the content is added and distributed to each device from. Once size doesn&#8217;t fit all.</p>
<p>Therefore, we need to breakdown our content into many fields that may be similar but have a different purpose. For example, a long summary, a short summary field.  There can no longer be a correlation between saving a page and immediately &#8216;seeing how it looks&#8217; on the desktop page only.</p>
<p>The purpose of a CMS, as we know it now, is to manage the content of your website. That&#8217;s it. Upload content. Add it to a WYSIWYG. Hit preview and look at it to make sure its formatted correctly. Then save and publish. It&#8217;s for the website. It&#8217;s a glorified magazine publisher. But, with all of the devices and apps that modern content is delivered to is this enough?</p>
<h2>Point 2: Drupal as the Content Hub</h2>
<p>It was a bit frustrating to hear the questions in the Q&amp;A after McGrane&#8217;s keynote and some of the discussion afterwards. It seemed the focus was on whether or not you should use a WYSIWYG or Markdown or something else and to allow inline editing or not.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a terrible discussion to have, I just think that misses the point. The point is that Drupal is much more marketable as tool than simply a CMS. It&#8217;s a content hub. That&#8217;s exciting.</p>
<p>As Drupal founder, Dries Buytaert, pointed out in his annual keynote, Drupal 8 will be even better positioned to be the desired content hub mentioned above. He showed new features that will allow Drupal use different content per screen breakpoint, and even better, the ability to create mobile apps! Packaged with the power of Content Types and a simpler editing interface, Drupal will be the spot to house your content, and Drupal will distribute your content. WordPress can&#8217;t come close.</p>
<blockquote><p>Note: I am currently in the process of a Drupal redesign for rachelbrandon.com. Stay tuned.</p></blockquote>
<p>In summation, the main thing I can take away is this: Device and App specific content is killing the CMS. So, in the words of R.E.M. I feel fine (because of Drupal).</p>
<p>Agree? Disagree? Chime in below.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently I’ve been reflecting on Motherhood (in addition to doing motherhood). Maybe it has something to do with wanting to be able to say wonderful things to the mothers in my life on Mothers Day and in order to do that well and to say true and uplifting things instead of empty or Hallmark marketed things that don’t actually have the thought behind them.<span id="more-957"></span> It also has something to do with the journey I’ve personally been on in figuring out motherhood while watching other “moms” in my life.</p>
<p>Although Mothers Day is frustrating and painful for many women and men, I also believe that it can be a significant day of hope. Here are the two reasons why I enjoy Mothers Day (I had hoped to think of a “top five reasons” or a “top ten reasons”, but really, all of my reasons boiled down to these two main themes):</p>
<h2>Honoring the Women in our Lives</h2>
<p>1. Mother’s Day has the potential to seriously honor the women in our midst &#8212; their individual and unique stories and our collective human story by understanding motherhood in a much broader sense than what is often communicated.</p>
<p>This means it is a day to honor women who are not yet moms, women who have lost children (aborted, miscarried, death, given away through adoption, violence and crime&#8230; loss is a significant burden to bare so why not come around the mothers and other family members who have known child loss and honor their suffering with them), women who have adopted children, women who in anyway are caring for the next generation of our society, single dads who are trying to be both a mom and dad, dads who want to be as much a part of nurturing their children as moms are stereotypically seen to do in our culture, uncles, aunties, neighbors who care about raising the children in their lives, etc. Motherhood is about caring for and nurturing life so celebrating Mothers Day can and should be about these broad amazing forces that motherhood represents.</p>
<h2>God as Mother</h2>
<p>2. Because it is a way to understand God as mother and how our mothers are as much a representation of Christ to our children and communities as our fathers.</p>
<p>I was thinking just how profound this realization was for me in my own feminine  and Christian identity and now as a mom myself. When it had been communicated to me over and over growing up that it is the dad/husband who (being compared to Christ), serves the wife/mom like the church, I felt patronized and devalued. I stand behind our dads and husbands and other men in our lives to be held to the lofty standard of self sacrifice, service, and love for others that only Christ has embodied in perfection. I affirm that wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>But when that same lofty standard is not also being asked of me because I am a woman, a wife, a mom then I felt it communicated a few lies. First that women don’t need to be Christ-like if they’ve got a good Christian man in their lives. And also, that women are less capable of living like Christ than men; or women just aren’t as important as men are.</p>
<p>When I started to understand God as both mother and father, and that I was made in the image of God as a girl, it empowered me to want to live more like Christ for the sake of my family around me and others in my community. It affirmed my marriage to be more mindful that Brandon and I can better represent Christ to our families and our neighbors together better than individually. It wasn’t just Brandon’s responsibility to be like Christ as the dad, it is mine as a mom as well. We are partners in the same call.</p>
<p>And the reality of that is very profound, because although we all fall short of perfection all the time, I notice that typically women are (whether expected to or not) sacrificing more for the sake of their children and their husbands. More so to the point where it isn’t even noticed by our communities anymore because it is seen as the “normal” thing that women should and would sacrifice (their passions, vocations, careers, where they live, their schedules, their bodies, etc.) for the sake of their husbands or families. So here we are as an evangelical Christian culture emphasizing how great our dads are for their Christ-like calling, and ignoring the connection between our moms&#8217; sacrifice and Christ&#8217;s sacrifice. </p>
<p>This is obviously not to say that men (husbands, dads, uncles, grandpas, brothers) aren’t sacrificing things for those they love, but I just see women doing it more often. I’m also not saying that sacrifice is bad, unless of course it is demanded and expected and forced of someone else, so I’m certainly not heaping shame on women for sacrificing things in their lives&#8230; sacrifice is an necessary part of love when offered freely.</p>
<p>My mom is an amazing woman, she deserves a lot of respect, and I’m left a little speechless when I actually spend time thinking about all of the ways she’s sacrificed herself (her desires, her vocation, her physical body) for her kids and husband. Let me put that another way:<em> She has laid down her life so that others might have life more abundantly.</em></p>
<p>To all the Bible readers out there, does that language sound familiar?</p>
<h2>Our Journey</h2>
<p>I remember when Brandon and I finally got pregnant and how thrilled we were! We had walked through a season of infertility that was particularly painful and difficult for us, and especially me. I can recall the intense emotional pain but I wouldn’t change the long and difficult way that we got pregnant because it made having our daughter mean so much more to us.</p>
<p>Pain brings meaning and significance, it makes the fight worth the effort. God went through the agonizing pain of being rejected, sending his son, watching his son be rejected, slandered, betrayed, and killed, and all that was (and still is) worth it to God because it He was able to give life to those He loved so much (us)!</p>
<p>This is the reason why I chose to try to do a natural childbirth. I didn’t want to medicate away the pain that would help me relate to God in a way that unfortunately my husband will never be able to personally physically experience. Again, I’m not saying that men are incapable of “being like Christ in his death” (Philippians 3:10) to bring about new life, but they are incapable of experiencing childbirth personally, which is a HUGE way that women are like Christ.</p>
<h2>Maternal Suffering: Devaluing Curse or Empowering Call?</h2>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-967" alt="babybirth" src="http://rachelbrandon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/babybirth-300x229.jpg" width="300" height="229" />Recently, I came across an article called <em><a href="http://cbmw.org/women/motherhood/paininchildbearing/">Pain in Childbearing</a></em>, that talks about the suffering involved in motherhood, specifically at birth and how Eve’s sin is the reason for the pain of birth. What it doesn’t present is a full picture of motherhood. What it misses is the redemptive power of Christ. Don’t get me wrong, childbirth will always cause immense pain, and this pain of motherhood will continue well after children have been birthed.</p>
<p>However, with the power of Christ, motherhood takes on a whole new meaning. Motherhood can be compared to God’s desire to have a meaningful relationship with us and to see us grow and prosper. I love being a mom because even though its painful (remember, painful also means meaningful), it is another way I can partner with God instead of being used as a symbol of an evil curse.</p>
<p>Another article I read recently is about <a href="http://www.barna.org/faith-spirituality/619-are-christians-more-like-jesus-or-more-like-the-pharisees">an interesting study Barna did</a> to try and observe whether Christians are more like Christ or more like pharisees. What I found specifically noteworthy was one of their findings that said men were 9% more likely to be less Christ-like in actions and attitudes and women were 18% more likely to be Christ-like in actions and attitudes.</p>
<p>Again, I do not bring this up to boast over my male partners in the Gospel, as if there is some ridiculous competition between men and women as to who is the best or the most holy. Instead, the goal would be to see men and women working more closely together, learning from and valuing one another so that together we could understand a more holistic and healthy view of God.</p>
<p>This way we may approach Him (Her?) more wholey and be healed ourselves individually and collectively. To do this, we need to be humble enough to learn from one another, women listening and learning from men, men listening and learning from women.</p>
<h2>Privilege Plays a Prominent Part</h2>
<p>My new friend and colleague, Steve Mattson, pointed out in his article <em><a href="http://www.redletterchristians.org/am-i-a-christian-bigot/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+RedLetterChristians+%28Red+Letter+Christians%29">Am I a Christian Bigot?</a></em>, that privilege many times can hinder our ability to see beyond ourselves. This seems it might be directly related to how one is able to be Christ-like or not. In our culture, men have historically had more privilege than women, and even though we’re making progress in gender equality, men still hold more privilege be it subconscious or conscious. I wonder if this is what Jesus was getting at when He talked about the ease of a camel getting through an eye of a needle versus the ease of a rich man getting into heaven. Perhaps the rich man’s privilege had built a huge barrier in his ability to be Christ-like? Perhaps men who are unaware of their privilege and their need to steward it well have let their privilege grow into a barrier that hinders them from being like Christ?</p>
<p>This can also be said of those of us who have privilege for other reasons: our race, our monetary wealth, our physical appearance, our ability, our sexual orientation, etc. I have been born with privilege that others haven’t been given at birth, nor will ever have in their lifetime, and I believe that another way I can model Christ is to be aware of my privilege and steward it well for the sake of my brothers and sisters who don’t have as strong a voice.</p>
<p>Some might assume that I’ve digressed a lot from my original topic: Mothers Day. But for me, all of these ideas join together in my celebration of Mothers Day. These are some of the big reasons why I love being a woman and a mother. The vast scope of what motherhood means to me is that you don’t have to be a mother in the conventional sense to be about “motherhood”. And that is beautiful.  Motherhood represents life in all its messy glory: privilege stewardship, Christ-likeness, sacrifice, love, progress and development, wisdom.</p>
<p>Happy Mothers Day to Everyone!</p>
