		<description><![CDATA[So you&#039;re suggesting we replace one complicated scoring system with ANOTHER complicated scoring system?  Piffle.  Can you imagine the refs and coaches arguing as to exactly where the initial touchdown pass/rush was made? I say KISS: Just get rid of the extra point for the kick and ONLY do 2 points for the rush.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with the need for a change in the PAT so I&#039;m actually excited to hear what does become of this. Robby Gould might not like it but he&#039;ll get over it. Your idea of kicking from the spot of the score is interesting!! I would like to see more 2 point conversions as it would make the game more exciting and allow the coaches to even have more control of every play called which I actually don&#039;t like but that could be a rant of my own which would take months for me to type so don&#039;t count on it!]]></description>
